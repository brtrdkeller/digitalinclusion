      Results from the  study show that  errors identified are aligned with accessibility evaluation literature: 65% of success criteria in WCAG do not reach 80% of agreement among raters which confirms the complexity of WCAG conformance. In total 62 (86%) criteria are marked as not being correctly addressed by automatic  tools  with  an overlap of those showing false positives, and 25 criteria (34%) are indicated as  difficult  to  evaluate  manually

      "This indicates that the websites of the universities studied are not fully accessible. Although there are regulations that promote web inclusion for all people, regardless of their disability status, it is necessary to promote educational campaigns that teach and motivate designers, digital content creators, and programmers to consider when developing websites."

    topic: Tests sur plusieurs services
    description: |-
      None of the 217 government websites examined adhered to all the WCAG 2.0 guidelines.
      Cross country analysis showed that there are three macro factors influencing e-government accessibility in SSA, namely Human Development Index (HDI), Corruption Perception Index (CPI), and percentage of the active population (15-64 years). Countries with high HDI levels and low CPI levels tend to have websites with fewer accessibility errors, while those for countries with high percentage of the active population have more accessibility errors

      Four practices in use were recognized as instrumental in the design and implementation of accessible e‐Government services : 
      1. championing accessibility; 
      2. adoption of an omni‐channel approach, as well as digital learning and awareness; 
      3. development of inhouse guidelines and best practices, as well as support for developing assistive technologies;
      4. reflective practices. (<https://se-realiser.com/pratique-reflexive/>)
