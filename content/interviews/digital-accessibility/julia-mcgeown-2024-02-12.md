**1. Your definition of Digital Accessibility**

**2. Do you know some legal framework defining the process for improving digital accessibility?**

**3. Can you identify the potential risks of not taking accessibility into account (for a digital service, in general, for HI's image...)?**

**4. Do you feel you have all the resources needed to implement a digital accessibility improvement initiative?**

**5. What are your immediate needs in terms of digital accessibility (communication, materials, legal, financial, management support, etc.)?**

**6. What would be your future needs in terms of digital accessibility (Innovation, ATI, recruitment,...)**

**7. What would you need to develop in HI to ensure that your mission discriminates as little as possible through the existence of digital interfaces?**

**8. What do you think of HI's approach to digital accessibility in-house and in the field?**

**9. Do you think an in-house expert would be needed, or a particular skill (why exactly)?**
