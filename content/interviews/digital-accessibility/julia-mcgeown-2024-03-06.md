Different everywhere
In the team themeself, in the staf, you see different accessibility, and it s spyky. volunteers try to make accessible... 
There is a range across HI, some are not accessible... not always.  

Projet
Depends what we are doing. Not really thinking in ombase... ut in learning is use to be accessible. We done things like screen Reader.
We provide different matérials or software. We learning about that.

We alose connecting AIAC, Work with vunerable people. My passion to introduce apps to voice, picture, allowing to people to have access to.
Less access to the content, be able to understand how to understand the content. 
Look to introduce to attention, use the technology at the level of the child.

 - Everybody jumping on technology. Digital revelotuion: game changer (for child). Let further behind. 
 - Make the point the everything is inclusive.

We know some basic things. 
Covid lot of thing where not accessible. What we could do instead. People are aware

**4. Do you feel you have all the resources needed to implement a digital accessibility improvement initiative?**

 - No

**5. What are your immediate needs in terms of digital accessibility (communication, materials, legal, financial, management support, etc.)?**

 - Focus point how to do that.

Test with children. ICT material are suitable, in term of support. Trackers. <= About material
At Dehli some people can't move. Do we have the founding. 
  - Guidance

We don't konw what we don't know

**6. What would be your future needs in terms of digital accessibility (Innovation, ATI, recruitment,...)**

 - We are growing on Headtech (link not the same thing than accessibility)
 - There is a movement in learning domain
 - We are more that on our target. 
 - What are n education sector
 - Connection with the team TIBET (inclusion economique) Mozambique
 - Synergy between this sector
 - Learn from the project we got (mastercard fundation)
 - Some experience app : Sign langage, audio book,... Luanda piloted.

**7. What would you need to develop in HI to ensure that your mission discriminates as little as possible through the existence of digital interfaces?**
 
 - More skills pilots
 - More research on evidence 
 - Stronger links in an Hub (In UK) :: Making sure we are a part of that, because their are project 

UNESCO Conference. What ressources from HI can I share. I promote what we doing. We could communite more. 
3D priting internaly

Lot of growth, to make more accessible for children (controverse, why more technology).

**8. What do you think of HI's approach to digital accessibility in-house and in the field?**

 - We are not bad in UK. A bit behind in other 
 - Easy read, alternative text,... is not that

**9. Do you think an in-house expert would be needed, or a particular skill (why exactly)?**

 - If we want for doing research. 
 - Some pockets, for specialy need.
 - Properly adapt a platform, we don't have the clue.
 - Get help for that.
 - Some much to learn and existing plateform

**Teachers**

Are target. In case a teacher with disabilities (their are forgotten).
Teach them how to taking care. Try the more with the training.
But don't know what is happening online.

ITA we should have more. I thing I'm not the best person for speaking about A11Y.
